My name is Punya Vashist and I'm an undergraduate Engineering student majoring in Computer Science. Ever since the age of 15, I've been programming, primarily, developing for the web through numerous projects.

More than my love for code is my love to learn, constantly. Right before I decided to create this site for myself, I was sitting with a cup of coffee brewing by my side, reading You Don't Know JS. I'm a FOSS supporter and use Fedora (a GNU/Linux distribution) on my Lenovo Thinkpad X220 and macOS on my MacBook Pro 2017.

I love creating and contributing to new projects, especially ones that tend to delve into catering to the FOSS community. Quite recenly though, I've noticed myself getting into design (Brand / Identity / UI) as well.

While not writing or learning code, I'm either functioning as a copywriter or playing the guitar. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/punyavashist), have a [chat here](https://t.me/punyavashist) or send a mail by clicking on this link that unexpecteadly opens the Mail Client you've never used- [punyavashist at pm dot me](mailto:punyavashist@pm.me).
