My name is Punya Vashist and I'm an undergraduate Engineering student majoring in Computer Science. Ever since the age of 15, I've been programming, primarily, developing for the web through numerous projects.

More than my love for code is my love to learn, constantly. Right before I decided to create this site for myself, I was sitting with a cup of coffee brewing by my side, reading You Don't Know JS. I'm a FOSS supporter and use Fedora (a GNU/Linux distribution) on my Lenovo Thinkpad X220 and macOS on my MacBook Pro 2017.

I love creating and contributing to new projects, especially ones that tend to delve into catering to the FOSS community. Quite recenly though, I've noticed myself getting into design (Brand / Identity / UI) as well.

While not writing or learning code, I'm either functioning as a copywriter or playing the guitar. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/punyavashist), have a [chat here](https://t.me/punyavashist) or send a mail by clicking on this link that unexpecteadly opens the Mail Client you've never used- [punyavashist at pm dot me](mailto:punyavashist@pm.me).

<p>Hello. I&rsquo;m Punya and I&rsquo;m an Engineering student majoring in Computer Science.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also a UI / UX designer in Chandigarh, India. Right now, I function as the UI / UX Lead over at <a href="https://learn-anything.xyz">LearnAnything</a>. In addition, I contribute articles to the <a href="https://xda-developers.com/author/punya-vashist">XDA Developers Portal</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/@punyavashist">Hackernoon</a>.</p>

<p>More than my passion for UI / UX and code is my passion to learn, constantly. If not churning up articles or working on new features, you&rsquo;d generally find me learning new programming languages or trying to master design tools.</p>

<p>I own a OnePlus 5- on which I use OxygenOS, a Lenovo X220 Thinkpad- on which I use Fedora and a 2017 Macbook Pro- on which I use macOS.</p>

<p>I do most of my design work in Figma and write most of my code in Visual Studio Code (I&rsquo;m editing this page in Atom, though. I like to keep trying alternatives.)</p>

<p>Most of my hobbies come and go but I&rsquo;ve never stopped playing the guitar and drums.</p>

<p>I like creating and contributing to new projects, especially ones that tend to delve into catering to the FOSS community- let&rsquo;s have a chat on <a href="https://t.co/crptck">Telegram</a> and build products together. Alternatively, you can find me on <a href="https://t.me/punyavashist">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/punyavashist">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/punyavashist">Github</a> and Discord (punya#0771). Or you can just send me a mail by clicking on this link that unexpecteadly opens the Mail Client you&rsquo;ve never used- <a href="mailto:punyavashist@pm.me">punyavashist at pm dot me</a>.</p>
